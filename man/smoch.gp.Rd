\title{Synthetic Minority Ovsersampling Convex Hull - Gower's distance with Podani modification}
\usage{
smoch.gp(y, data, k = 5, oversampling = NULL, outlier = FALSE, out_amp = 1.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The name or column index of the dependent variable, which contains the imbalanced classes (required);}

\item{data}{A dataframe presenting class imbalance (required);}

\item{k}{The number of k-nearest neighbours to consider, the default value is 5;}

\item{oversampling}{The oversampling ratio to apply. Accepted values must be greater than 0 and multiples of 10. If unspecified, the defaults is the maximum possible ratio for the given dataset;}

\item{outlier}{A boolean argument indicating whether the SMOCH-GP function should be adapted to account for potential outliers. The default value is FALSE;}

\item{out_amp}{Allows the user to customise the threshold from which an observation is considered an outlier. This parameter is only active when outlier = TRUE, otherwise, it is ignored. By default, an observation is considered an outlier if it lies below or above the first or third quartile by more than out_amp*Interquartile Range (default value out_amp=1.5).}
}
\value{
\bold{Newdata} - A resulting dataset consists of original minority observations, synthetic minority observations and original majority observations. A vector of their respective target classes is included in the final column.

\bold{Synthetic_obs} - A dataset containing only the new synthetic observations generated.

\bold{SMOCH_GP_info} - Provides information about the user-specified input parameters, including the number of K-nearest neighbours considered, the over-sampling percentage, and the out_amp value, if used. It also summarises the class imbalance problem present in the dataset, reporting the total number of observations from the minority class and the corresponding imbalance ratio.
}
\description{
This function generates synthetic observations for the minority class in a given dataset exhibiting class imbalance. It was specifically designed for mixed-type datasets—i.e., those containing heterogeneous variable types—although it is also compatible with more uniform datasets, such as those composed solely of numerical or categorical variables, for example.
