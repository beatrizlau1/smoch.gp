Description: This function generates synthetic observations for the minority class in a given dataset exhibiting class imbalance. It was specifically designed for mixed-type datasets—i.e., those containing heterogeneous variable types—although it is also compatible with more uniform datasets, such as those composed solely of numerical or categorical variables, for example.
